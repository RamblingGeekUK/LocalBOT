WinUI3 Windows BOT for twitch

So the idea is to play around with WinUI3, so I figured I would build my Twitch bot using this tech for a modern UI.  Think a simplier [streamer.bot](https://streamer.bot).  This is ealier days, working with OBS Websockets and trying to figure out how to do WinUI3 UI. :-)

Progress so far.
